    "# West Nile Virus Prediction for Chicago\n",
    "Analyzed datasets and predicting whether or not West Nile virus is present, for a given time, location, and species. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every year from late-May to early-October, public health workers in Chicago setup mosquito traps scattered across the city. Every week from Monday through Wednesday, these traps collect mosquitos, and the mosquitos are tested for the presence of West Nile virus before the end of the week. The test results include the number of mosquitos, the mosquitos species, and whether or not West Nile virus is present in the cohort. \n",
